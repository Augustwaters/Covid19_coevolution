# Covid19 coevolution

This repostery contains the simulation code for the research project on the coevolution of SARS-CoV-2.
Link to article to be added.

Model parameters such as the efficiency of differen non pharmaceutical interventions, or the basic reproduction rate of SARS-CoV-2, as well as mutation rates, or learning rates for policies, can be easily changed in the code.

The code is designed to work on Google Colab, and the script is self sufficient to run.
