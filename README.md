# Covid19 coevolution

This project contains the simulation code for the research project on the coevolution of SARS-CoV-2.

Emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants from the coevolution of viruses and policy interventions (2021), arXiv. Accepted at ALife 2021 https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14366 

Modelling SARS-CoV-2 coevolution with genetic algorithms (2021), arXiv. STEM Volume Covid-19: A Complex Systems Approach https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12365

Model parameters such as the efficiency of different non pharmaceutical interventions, or the basic reproduction rate of SARS-CoV-2, as well as mutation rates, or learning rates for policies, can be easily changed in the code. The code is designed to work on Google Colab, and the script is self sufficient to run.
